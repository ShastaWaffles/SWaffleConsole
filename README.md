# SWaffle Console v1.0 for PEAK
SWaffle Console is an external debugging tool for the game PEAK. This plugin is a custom-made plugin for myself (Shasta) that I want to share with others who may find it interesting or may want to utilize it themselves. This is an ongoing project, and I have many plans to adapt it. Source code is available for both the game plugin and the Windows application client. It is recommended to build both the plugin and the Windows application if using the source code; otherwise, I have released a ZIP file of the built plugin and Windows application. 

##### Caution: Plugin may cause crashing - Start game first and then open client.

[Download Dev v1.0 Release](https://github.com/ShastaWaffles/SWaffleConsole/releases/tag/v1.0-dev)


## How to use
- Place the game plugin into the BepInEx/Plugins folder.
